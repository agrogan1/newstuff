# Data Source ðŸŒ²

The data used in this example are derived from the R package *Functions and Datasets for "Forest Analytics with R"*.

According to the documentation, the source of these data are: "von Guttenbergâ€™s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data."

![Old Tjikko, a 9,550 Year Old Norway Spruce in Sweden](Old-Tjikko-Small.jpg)

The documentation goes on to further note that:

> "The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps."

    use gutten.dta, clear
		
`use "https://github.com/agrogan1/newstuff/raw/master/mlm-R2-gutten/gutten.dta", clear` should work to obtain the data over the web. Please let me know if it does not.

# Variables ðŸŒ²

`site` Growth *quality* class of the treeâ€™s habitat. 5 levels.

`location` Distinguishes tree *location*. 7 levels.

`tree` An identifier for the tree within location.

`age.base` The tree age taken at ground level.

> It might be best to use a centered age variable, centered at the grand mean of tree age: 

    egen ageMEAN = mean(age_base)
	
	generate ageCENTERED = age_base - ageMEAN

`height` Tree height, m.

`dbh.cm` Tree diameter, cm.

`volume` Tree volume.

`age.bh` Tree age taken at 1.3 m.

`tree.ID` A factor uniquely identifying the tree.

# Your Quantitative Forestry Tasks (Should You Choose To Accept Them) ðŸŒ²

I clearly need to learn more about quantitative approaches to forestry, but I would like to model tree height as a function of tree age (measured at base), site, and location.

# Spaghetti Plot ðŸŒ²

Use `spagplot` to examine these relationships. Remember that the `spagplot` syntax is `spagplot y x, id(id)`.  What is the most appropriate id variable here?

    spagplot height ageCENTERED, id(tree_ID) scheme(michigan)
	
    graph export myspagplot.png, width(500) replace
	
`spagplot height ageCENTERED, id(tree_ID) scheme(s1rcolor)` also works well here.

# Multilevel Models ðŸŒ²

## Unconditional Model

Run an unconditional model with `mixed`. What Stata syntax do you use? What is the corresponding equation? What question is this syntax and equation asking and answering? Calculate the ICC. What does this number tell you?

## Conditional Model 

Now run a model with `mixed` where you examine the relationship of tree age, site, and location with tree height. Do any of your variables need to be treated as indicator (`i.`) variables? 

What Stata syntax do you use? What is the corresponding equation? What question is this syntax and equation asking and answering? What do you find?

What if you examine $\text{age of tree}^2$ as part of your model?

> `generate ageMEAN2 = ageMEAN^2`

Does the ICC have any meaning after your *conditional* model?
