# Background

*Risks* and *Odds* are different but related quantities. It it important to understand how each is mathematically defined and to understand what each quantity implies. In some cases, the *odds* may overstate the *risk*.

# Setup

<style>body {max-width: 90%} h1 {color: #00274C;} h2 {color: #2F65A7;} p{font-size: 115%} blockquote {border-left: 5px solid #ffcb05; margin: 1.5em 10px; padding: 0.5em 10px;} code {color: red;}</style>

    clear all
	
We are going to set up a table with 10 rows of information.

    set obs 10 // 10 rows of information

    generate occasions = 100 // 100 hypothetical occasions
	
In each row of the table our *event of interest* happened a different number of times. 

In the code below we make use of Stata's special variable for the row number of a data set: `_n`.

    generate event_happened = _n * 10
	
As a result, the *event of interest* *didn't* happen $100 - \text{happened}$ times.

    generate event_didnt_happen = 100 - event_happened
	
> As you think through the rest of this example, it might be worth giving yourself a concrete example of the *event of interest*. What is a concrete example of a good thing that might happen, or a bad thing that might happen?
	
# Our Table of Information So Far
	
Let's list out our table of information so far:

    list, abbreviate(20)
	
# Risk

Now let's think about risk: 

$$
    \text{risk} = P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{number of events that happened}}{\text{number of events that happened} + \text{number of events that didn't happen}}
$$

    generate risk_event_happened = event_happened / (event_happened + event_didnt_happen)
	
There is also a risk that the event didn't happen.

    generate risk_event_didnt_happen = event_didnt_happen / (event_happened + event_didnt_happen)
	
# Odds

The odds are the probability that an event happened divided by the probability that it did not happen

$$
    \text{odds} = \frac{P(\text{event happened})}{P(\text{event didn't happen})}
$$

$$
    = \frac{\frac{\text{number of events}}{\text{number of events} + \text{number of non-events}}}{\frac{\text{number of non-events}}{\text{number of events} + \text{number of non-events}}}
$$

    generate odds = risk_event_happened / risk_event_didnt_happen

which incidentally reduces to

$$
    = \frac{\text{number of events}}{\text{number of non-events}}
$$

# Look At Our Table Of Information

Let's look at our table of information. 

> <mark>Notice how the odds start to overstate the risk, as the risk becomes more common.</mark>

    list event_happened ///
	risk_event_happened ///
	odds, ///
	abbreviate(20)

We can even graph this.

    twoway scatter odds risk_event_happened event_happened, ///
	title("Risk and Odds") ///
	xtitle("How many times out of 100 did this happen?") ///
	scheme(michigan) ///
	legend(pos(3) order(1 "odds" 2 "risk"))
