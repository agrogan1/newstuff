# The Data

We use the French Skiiers data that we have used in other examples.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

library(Statamarkdown)

```

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

use "FrenchSkiiers.dta"

```

# Contingency Table

```{stata}

tabulate Tx Outcome [fweight = Count]

```

For the sake of teaching and exposition, I re-arrange the numbers slightly.

|             | Develop Outcome   | Do Not Develop Outcome   |
|-------------|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|
| Exposed     | a                 | b                        |
| Not Exposed | c                 | d                        |

|                 | Cold              | No Cold                  |
|-----------------|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|
| Ascorbic Acid   | 17 (a)            | 122 (b)                  |
| Placebo         | 31 (c)            | 109 (d)                  |

## Risk ($R$) and Risk Differences ($RD$)

$R = \frac{a}{a+b}$ (in Exposed)

$RD =$

$\text{risk in exposed} - \text{risk in not exposed} =$

$a/(a+b) - c/(c+d) =$ 

$(17/139) - (31/140) =$ 

$-.09912641$ 

> How do we talk about this *risk difference*?

## Odds Ratios ($OR$)

|             | Develop Outcome   | Do Not Develop Outcome   |
|-------------|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|
| Exposed     | a                 | b                        |
| Not Exposed | c                 | d                        |

$OR =$ 

$\frac{\text{odds that exposed person develops outcome}}{\text{odds that unexposed person develops outcome}} =$ 

$\frac{\frac{a}{a+b} / \frac{b}{a+b}}{\frac{c}{c+d} / \frac{d}{c+d}} =$

$\frac{a/b}{c/d} =$

$\frac{ad}{bc} =$ 

$(17 * 109)/(122 * 31) =$

$.4899526$

# Logistic Regression

As discussed, the formula for logistic regression is: 

$$\ln \Big(\frac{p(\text{outcome})}{1-p(\text{outcome})} \Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$$

Here $p(\text{outcome})$ is the probability of the outcome.

$\frac{p(\text{outcome})}{1-p(\text{outcome})}$ is the *odds* of the outcome.

Hence, $\ln \Big(\frac{p(\text{outcome})}{1-p(\text{outcome})} \Big)$[^TDV] is the *log odds* of the outcome.

[^TDV]: It is sometimes useful to think of the *log odds* as a *transformed dependent variable*. We have transformed the dependent variable so that it can be expressed as a linear function of the independent variables, e.g.: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$

::: {.callout-tip}
## The logistic regression equation has the desired functional form.

The logistic regression equation is appropriate to reflect changes in the probability of an outcome that can be either 1 or 0.

```{stata}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

graph export "logistic.png", replace

```

![Logistic Curve](logistic.png){width=50%}
:::

Logistic regression returns a $\beta$ coefficient for each independent variable $x$.

These $\beta$ coefficients can then be *exponentiated* to obtain *odds ratios*: $OR = e^{\beta}$ 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Exponentiation "undoes" the logarithmic transformation.

If $\ln(y) = x$, then $y = e^x$

So, if ... $\ln \Big(\frac{p(\text{outcome})}{1-p(\text{outcome})}\Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ then $\frac{p(\text{outcome})}{1-p(\text{outcome})} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x} = e^{\beta_0} \times e^{\beta_1 x}$

> We see that the odds ratio given by logistic regression, `.4899526`, is the exact same as that given by manually calculating the odds ratio from a contingency table.

> An advantage of logistic regression is that it can be extended to multiple independent variables.
