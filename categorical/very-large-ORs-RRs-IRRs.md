# Very Large OR's or RR's or IRR's

One sometimes sees *extremely large* OR's or RR's or IRR's.

1. Is this due to very low base rates of one category of the outcome? Those can inflate RR's and OR's.
2. What are the units of the independent variables? For example if your independent variable is a percentage expressed on a 0 to 1.0 scale, that can radically inflate your estimates. Rescaling the independent variable sometimes helps.
3. Is this an issue of complete, or near complete separation? i.e. one variable almost perfectly predicts the outcome? That too can lead to very large OR's or RR's.

There may be other possibilities, but if one of the above strategies does not solve the problem, I would suggest deleting the variable from your model if possible.
