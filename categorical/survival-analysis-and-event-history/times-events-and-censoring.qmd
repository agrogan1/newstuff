# Introduction

Think about a hypothetical event: e.g. *birth*, *death*, *partnering*, *marriage* or *commitment* to a partner, *entering a program*, *leaving a program*, *attaining a degree*, *first diagnosis of anxiety or depression*, etc.

# Simulate Data

```{r}

set.seed(2779) # random seed

N <- 10 # sample size

T <- 10 # number of timepoints

id <- rep(seq(1, N), each = T) # id's 1 to N

x <- rep(rbinom(N, 1, .5), each = T) # random time invariant covariate

t <- rep(seq(1, T), N) # timepoints 1 to T

# random event times

# uniform event times

event_time <- rep(round(runif(N, 3, T), 
                        digits = 0), 
                  each = T)

event <- t >= event_time # event has occurred t >= event_time

event <- factor(event, 
                levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), 
                labels = c("No Event", "Event"))

# arbitrarily censored after 7

censored <- event_time > 7 

censored <- factor(censored, 
                   levels = c(FALSE, TRUE), 
                   labels = c("Not Censored", "Censored"))

# tibble

# data required for animation

mydata <- tibble::tibble(id, x, t, event_time, event, censored)

mydata2 <- mydata %>%
  filter(t == 1) %>%
  select(id, x, event_time, censored)

mydata3 <- mydata %>% 
  filter(t <= event_time)

```

```{r}

write_dta(mydata3, "event-history-multiple-records.dta")

write_dta(mydata2, "event-history-single-record.dta")

```

# Animated Graph

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

library(plotly)

```

Individuals in the animation below who have not yet experienced an event are indicated by a <span style="font-size: 150%">&#x25CF;</span>. 

When an event occurs for an individual, the symbol changes to a <span style="font-size: 150%">&#10005;</span>.

In this simulation, we imagine that the study period ends after time 7, so observations for which the event occurs after time 7 are considered to be *censored*: i.e. a failure is not observed. 

Censored observations (*failure not observed*) are **maize** <span style="color: #FFCB05">&#x2B24;</span>, and non-censored observations (*failure observed*) are **blue** <span style="color: #00274C">&#x2B24;</span>.[^language]

[^language]: Note that the language of survival analysis comes from medical studies of time until death, and engineering studies of mechanical failure. So *surviving* refers to *surviving* until the event of interest occurs, and *failure* means that the event of interest is observed during the study period. *Censored* means that the event of interest is **not** observed during the study period.

```{r}

pal <- c("#00274C", "#FFCB05") # color palette

p2 <- plot_ly(data = mydata, # use mydata
              x = ~t, # x is t (time)
              y = ~id, # y is id
              frame = ~t, # frames based on t (time)
              text = ~paste("Event:" ,
                            event,
                            "<br>Censored:",
                            censored),
              type = 'scatter',
              mode = 'marker',
              color = ~censored, # color is censored (yes / no)
              colors = pal, # use color palette
              symbol = ~as.numeric(event), # symbol is event (occurred / not occurred)
              symbols = c('circle', # event not occurred
                          'x'), # event
              marker = list(size = 15)) %>% # marker size
  layout(title = 'Hypothetical Timing of Events \nCensored at Time 7',
         shapes = list(type='line', # censoring line
                       x0 = 7, 
                       x1 = 7, 
                       y0 = 0, 
                       y1 = 10, 
                       line=list(dash='dot', 
                                 width=1, 
                                 color = "red"))) %>%

# What These Data Look Like

::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}

## The Basic Idea of **stset** and the Survival Curve

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

library("survival")

library("survminer")

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

fit <- survfit(Surv(event_time, censored == "Not Censored") ~ 1, 
               data = mydata2)

# nice-ish survival curve

ggsurvplot(fit,
           conf.int = TRUE, # show CI
           ggtheme = theme_minimal(),
           palette = c("#00274C")) + # Michigan blue
  labs(title = "Survival Curve") 

```

The general format for the `stset` command is `stset t, failure(f)`. Here `t` is the time variable, and `f` is an indicator of *failure*, i.e. the event of interest happened before the study concluded.

```{stata}
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

use "event-history-single-record.dta"

stset event_time, failure(censored == 1) // set event time and failvar

sts graph, xline(7, lcolor("red")) // survival curve w line at 7

graph export survival.png, replace

```

![Survival Graph](survival.png){#fig-survival}

## Simple Event History Data

```{r}

datatable(mydata2, 
          extensions = 'Buttons', 
          options = list(
            dom = 'Bfrtip',
            buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel')),
          caption = "Simple Event History Data")

```

```{stata}
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

use "event-history-single-record.dta"

stset event_time, failure(censored == 1) // set event time and failvar

```

## Data in Multiple Record Form

Notice how every row in this particular data set is a *person timepoint*, **not** simply a *person*.  Every *person* in this data has *multiple rows*.

```{r}

datatable(mydata3, 
          extensions = 'Buttons', 
          options = list(
            dom = 'Bfrtip',
            buttons = c('copy', 'csv', 'excel')),
          caption = "Data in Multiple Record Form")

```

```{stata}

use "event-history-multiple-records.dta"

stset t, failure(event == 2) id(id) // stset

```
