.25                       The odds of the outcome for Group A
                          were 25% of the odds of the other 
                          group.
                          
                          The odds of the outcome for Group A
                          were 75% lower than for the other

1.0                       The odds of the outcome for Group A
                          were equivalent to (the same as)
                          the odds for the other group.
                          
                          There was no difference between Group A
                          and the other group.
                          
1.5                       The odds of the outcome for Group A
                          were 1.5 times those for the other 
                          group.
                          
                          The odds of the outcome for Group A

                          other group. (technically correct,
                          but at the very least confusing?)
                          
                          The odds of the outcome for Group A
                          were 2.0 (twice) those for the other

                          group. (technically correct,
                          but at the very least confusing?)
