# Multiple Uses For Multilevel Modeling

Multilevel modeling is useful in a number of situations with clustering.

| Model | Clustering or Nesting |
|--|--|
| Nested or clustered cross-sectional data | People inside social units such as families, classrooms, schools or neighborhoods, … inside states, countries, etc. |
| Longitudinal data | Measurement occasions inside people (multiple time points; different people have very different time points) |
| Meta-Analysis | People inside multiple studies concerning a particular outcome |
| Meta-Analysis of Multiple Outcomes | People inside multiple studies concerning different outcomes |
| Dyadic analysis (e.g. couples; parent and child in family) | People inside dyads |
| Combinations of these approaches | |

# Developing Some Notation

Our notation for logistic regression model is:

$$
    \ln \Big( \frac{p(\text{outcome})}{1 - p(\text{outcome})} \Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ...
$$

which after *exponentiating* both sides, and some rearrangement, can be written:

$$
    p(\text{outcome}) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ...}}{1 +e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ...}} =
$$

$$
    F(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ...)
$$

where $F(z) = \frac{e^z}{1 + e^z}$, which is the logistic distribution.

So in adapting this notation for the multilevel context, we are ultimately going to write the notation for the multilevel logistic regression model as:

$p(outcome | \text{unique intercept for each unit}) = F(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + u_{0j})$

# Stata Commands

> Multilevel models have complicated likelihoods. As we move toward the middle to end of this table, models may have difficulty converging.
