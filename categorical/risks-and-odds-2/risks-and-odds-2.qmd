events <- rep(100, 10)

x_happens <- seq(10, 100, 10)

risk <- x_happens / events

odds <- ((x_happens / events)) / ((100 - x_happens) / events)

odds <- round(odds, 2)

mydata <- data.frame(events, x_happens, risk, odds)

```

# Risk

Let's think about risk: 

$$\text{risk} = P(\text{event}) = \frac{\text{number of events that happened}}{\text{number of events that happened} + \text{number of events that didn't happen}}$$

# Odds

The odds are the probability that an event happened divided by the probability that it did not happen

$$\text{odds} = \frac{P(\text{event happened})}{P(\text{event didn't happen})}$$

$$= \frac{\frac{\text{number of events}}{\text{number of events} + \text{number of non-events}}}{\frac{\text{number of non-events}}{\text{number of events} + \text{number of non-events}}}$$

which incidentally reduces to

$$= \frac{\text{number of events}}{\text{number of non-events}}$$

# Visualize The Risk And Odds

Imagine an *Event X*. This event could be entering a program, exiting a program, or getting a diagnosis of a mental health or physical health condition.
