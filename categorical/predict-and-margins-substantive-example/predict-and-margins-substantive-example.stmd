# Background

Odds ratios, or coefficients showing the association of the independent variables with the log odds, represent the most immediate output of a logistic regression. However, for a variety of reasons, it may make sense to not only report odds ratios, but also to investigate predicted probabilities.

# The Data

The data are an extract of the *National Survey of Children's Health, 2018*. The data contain information on children's current depression status, their exposure to various *Adverse Childhood Experiences* (ACEs) and their sex and race.

    use "NSCH_ACES.dta", clear

    describe depress ace1R ace3R ace4R ace5R ace6R ace7R ace8R ace9R

# Logistic Regression

We estimate a logistic regression using `,or` to ask for *odds ratios*.

    logit depress ace1R ace3R ace4R ace5R ace6R ace7R ace8R ace9R i.sc_race_r i.sc_sex, or

# Predicted Probabilities

Predicted probabilities are *each participant's individual predicted probability* of experiencing depression based upon the independent variables included in the model.  We often denote such predicted probabilities with $\hat{y}$

    predict yhat

`yhat` is a variable in the data, just like any other variable, and we can tabulate and graph it.

    tabulate sc_race_r, summarize(yhat)

    graph bar yhat, ///
	over(sc_race_r, label(angle(forty_five))) ///
	title("Predicted Probability of Depression") ///
	scheme(michigan)
	
	graph export mybar.png, width(500) replace

# Predicted Margins (Over A Variable of Interest)

In their simplest form, predictive margins are *average predicted probabilities* were everyone in the sample were treated as if they were of a particular race.

    margins sc_race_r // predictive margins 
	
> We could also evaluate `margins` holding other variables at their *mean* values using the `atmeans` option. You can also read about obtaining `margins` for various combinations of the independent variables by typing `help margins` at the Stata prompt.
	
The essential graphing command is `marginsplot`, which will usually produce a perfectly useable graph. The other graphing options are added for clarification and aesthetic purposes.
