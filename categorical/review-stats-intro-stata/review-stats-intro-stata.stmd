> Simulated data on social service clients

    use clients.dta, clear // use (get) the data
	
	describe

# One Line Stata

`do_something to_variable(s), options`

> Quite often the default options are so well chosen that you do not need to specify any options.

* `use mydata.dta`
* `summarize` // descriptive statistics
* `keep x1 x2 x3` // keep only selected variables
* `list x1 x2 x3 in 1/10` // list cases for selected variables
* `browse` // look at data
* `lookfor [word]` // look for variables with a particular word

# The Stata Interface

![The Stata Interface](Slide1.png)

# Measures of Central Tendency

* What are *mean* and *median*. Why are they different? 
* Where is standard deviation? 
* Subsets of variables?
* Finding variables?

    summarize 
	
	summarize age, detail
	
# Measures of Variation

> Some programs, e.g. *R* make you search for standard deviation. With Stata, *sd* is easily accessible with `summarize`.

    histogram mental_health_T1, normal scheme(burd)
	
	graph export myhistogram.png, width(500) replace

# Comparing Continuous and Continuous Variables

    twoway scatter mental_health_T1 age, msymbol(o) scheme(burd)
	
	graph export myscatter.png, width(500) replace

## Correlation

    pwcorr mental_health_T1 age, sig

# Comparing Continuous Variables Across Categorical Variables

	graph bar mental_health_T2, over(program) scheme(burd)

	graph export mybargraph.png, width(500) replace

![bar graph of mental health at time 2](mybargraph.png)

## t-test

    preserve // preserve data set

    keep if program == 1 | program == 2 // only keep 2 programs for now
	
	ttest mental_health_T2, by(program)
	
## ANOVA

    restore // restore old version of data
	
	oneway mental_health_T2 program, tabulate // oneway analysis of variance
	
> Importantly, `,tabulate` gives us a table of results.
	
# Regression 

* What is the equation?
* What do the results mean?
* What is substantively or statistically significant?

    regress mental_health_T2 mental_health_T1 i.program
	
# What if We Want to Allow For Different Slopes?

> Instructor will draw this out.

    regress mental_health_T2 c.mental_health_T1##i.program

# Regression Assumptions and the Issue of "Normality"

# Questions?
