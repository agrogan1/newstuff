## Introduction

We consider the logarithm. One very simple way to present the logarithm is to use the constant $e$.

Let's first consider the exponential function with base $e$, $y = e^x$

If $y = e^x$, then $\ln(y) = x$.

## Graphing Logarithmic Function

Note that in the equation above, we are taking the logarithm of $y$. To get some quick sense of how the logarithm behaves, we are going to graph $y = \ln(x)$.

## Logistic Regression

In logistic regression, which we are discussing in more detail in this course, we consider the *odds* of our outcome: 

$$\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)}$$

We will be working with the *log odds*:

$$\ln(\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)})$$

To graph these *log odds*, we need to solve for $p(y)$:

$$p(y) = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}$$

## Logarithmic Spiral

An interesting sidenote is that the logarithm forms the basis of the logarithmic spiral. The equation for a logarithmic spiral in polar coordinates is: $r = ae^{b \theta}$, where $\theta$ is the angle, $r$ is the radius, and $a$ and $b$ are constants.

Logarithmic spirals can be found in nature in the *nautilus shell*, and in *sunflowers*.
