## Why R?

- Open source
- World wide community
- Free
- Used by organizations like Google, *New York Times*, *Financial Times*

> Let's make sure we understand installing R, and calling libraries.

## Why R? (2)

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# load relevant libraries

library(car) 
library(rgl)
library(rglwidget)

scatter3d(GSS2014$coninc,
          GSS2014$health,
          GSS2014$depress, 
          xlab = "income",
          ylab = "health",
          zlab = "depress")

```

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

library(plotly)

myplot <- ggplot(subset(GSS2014, 
                        !is.na(health)), # health is not missing
                 aes(x = health, # x is health
                     y = coninc, # y is income
                     color = health)) + # color is health
  geom_jitter() + # draw jittered points
  geom_boxplot() + # draw boxplots
  labs(title = "Health And Income",
       y = "Income in Constant $",
       x = "Health")

ggplotly(myplot)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(plotly) # this is a helpful comment

p <- plot_ly(GSS2014, # the data I am using
             x = ~coninc, # income in CONSTANT $
             y = ~depress, # depression
             color = ~health, # color by poorhealth
             z = ~health, # poor health
             type = "scatter3d", # 3D scatterplot
             mode = "markers")

```

```{r, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

htmltools::tagList(list(as_widget(p))) # code provided by plotly.org
                   
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

p <- ggplot(GSS2014, # my data
            aes(x=coninc, y=health)) + # my "aesthetic"
  geom_smooth() + # the geometry of my graph
  ggtitle("Poor Health by Income") + 
  xlab("Income") + ylab("Health")

ggplotly(p)

```

## What are we doing???

- Start R
- Get some data in it
- A few descriptive statistics
- Some graphs

## Using General Social Survey (GSS) for Example

 - General Social Survey:  Nationally representative sample collected annually or biannually from 1972 to 2010.

 - When downloading data, download data from CANVAS to Mac or Windows desktop, then start RStudio to open with R.
 
## Data Are Just Rows and Columns 

We use both the codebook and data set.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}

library(png)

library(grid)

img <- readPNG("what-is-data.png")

grid.raster(img)

```

## Scripting (R Syntax)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}

library(png)

library(grid)

img <- readPNG("why write a script.png")

grid.raster(img)

```


```{r archive, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

## The "Thought Ladder of Statistics"

![](thought ladder.png)

## Counting Words in Shakespeare Plays (1)

![](Shakespeare.png)

## Counting Words in Shakespeare Plays (2)

![](Shakespeare2.png)

```

## Get Data (Script)

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# local file

# make sure you are in the right directory
# Menu: Session | Set Working Directory

load("GSS2014.Rdata") 

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# from the web

load(url("http://www.umich.edu/~agrogan/SW673labs/GSS2014.RData"))

```

Menu option as well

* Loading your data is sometimes the hardest part.
* Load is for data that is ALREADY IN R FORMAT!
* Pay attention to WHERE your data and scripts live.
* Note that R uses forward slashes:  /

## The R Interface

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4}

library(png)

library(grid)

img <- readPNG("R interface.png")

grid.raster(img)

```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

## Measures of Central Tendency

 - We need to make sure to recode missing data appropriately.

mydata$x[mydata$x == -9] <- NA # recode x == -9 to "NA"

```

## Measures of Central Tendency

- What are the mean, median, and mode? Why are they different?

```{r}

summary(GSS2014$coninc)

library(psych) # to load psych

describe(GSS2014$coninc)

```

## We End With a Graph

```{r}

hist(GSS2014$coninc,
     col = "blue") # histogram of the income variable

```

## And Another

```{r}

pie(table(GSS2014$sex),
    labels=c("male", "female"),
    col = c("blue", "gold"))

```
