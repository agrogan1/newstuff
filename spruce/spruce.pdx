Chihara and Hesterberg (2018) provide a data set concerning the growth
of Black Spruce Trees. According to these authors:

\begin{quote}
``Black spruce (Picea mariana) is a species of a slow-growing coniferous
tree found across the northern part of North America. It is commonly
found on wet organic soils. In a study conducted in the 1990s, a
biologist interested in factors affecting the growth of the black spruce
planted its seedlings on sites located in boreal peatlands in northern
Manitoba, Canada (Camil et al.~(2010)). The data set Spruce contains a
part of the data from the study (Table 1.8). Seventy-two black spruce
seedlings were planted in four plots under varying conditions
(fertilizer--no fertilizer, competition--no competition), and their
heights and diameters were measured over the course of 5 years. The
researcher wanted to see whether the addition of fertilizer or the
removal of competition from other plants (by weeding) affected the
growth of these seedlings.''

\hypertarget{the-research-question}{%
\section{The Research Question ðŸŒ²}\label{the-research-question}}

\begin{quote}
We are going to consider the \emph{potentially causal} estimate of the
effect of \emph{fertilizer} on \emph{tree height at year 5}. Along the
way we will give brief attention to the advantages and disadvantages of
each approach. Because of the research design, we have strong reasons to
consider \emph{fertilizer} as having a causal effect on \emph{tree
height} but we will nonetheless explore this question using a variety of
statistical models.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
A secondary purpose of this document is to demonstrate that Stata syntax
makes it easy to test and compare multiple statistical models because of
the uniform Stata syntax, which is almost always:
\texttt{command\ variable(s),\ options}.

\hypertarget{causality}{%
\section{Causality ðŸŒ²}\label{causality}}

\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth,height=\textheight]{causality.png}

A variable \(x\) can only be considered to have \emph{causal}
association with \(y\) if the following conditions are met (Holland,
1986):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(x\) is correlated with \(y\).
\item
  \(x\) precedes \(y\) in time order.
\item
  The association between \(x\) and \(y\) can not be accounted for by
  any third variable \(z\).
\end{enumerate}

Hence, for this particular data, we are exploring:

\begin{quote}
What happens to the association of \emph{fertilizer} and \emph{tree
height} when we control for possible confounding variables \(z\) using
various statistical strategies?
\end{quote}

Let's consider in turn each of the criteria for causality.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Empirically, \emph{fertilizer} is correlated with \emph{tree height}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  From the research design, we know that \emph{fertilizer} comes prior
  to \emph{tree height at year 5}.
\item
  We are going to use various statistical strategies--detailed below--to
  assess whether the association of \emph{fertilizer} and \emph{tree
  height} can be accounted for by any third variable.

\hypertarget{t-test}{%
\subsection{t Test}\label{t-test}}

A t test compares the difference between the means of two groups to the
standard error of the difference between means.

Formally, \(t = \frac{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1}{s}\) where s is the
standard error of the estimate of the mean.

More colloquially, the t test compares the differences between the two
groups in standard error units.

A t test does \emph{not} control for any additional variable(s).

\hypertarget{ols-regression}{%
\subsection{OLS Regression}\label{ols-regression}}

A regression estimates the association of a 1 unit change in each of the
independent variables with change in the dependent variable, while
accounting for all of the other independent variables in the model.

\(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \Sigma \beta_k x_{ki} + e_i\)

Here \(x_{1i}\) is the treatment variable of interest.

A regression controls for the additional observed variables (\(x_{ki}\))
that are included in the model.

The association of fertilizer with tree height is \{\{.10\}\}.

\hypertarget{propensity-scores}{%
\subsection{Propensity Scores}\label{propensity-scores}}

The propensity score estimates the probability of being administered the
treatment, in this example, \emph{fertilizer}. Treatment observations
are matched to the most similar comparison group observation in terms of
this probability, and an average difference is calculated.

A propensity score analysis controls for the additional observed
variables that are included in the model.
